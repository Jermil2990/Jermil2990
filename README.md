# Hi, I'm Jerrick! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a **Software engineer**, **UX designer**, and **Game developer** at LSU passionate about using technology to design meaningful, user-focused experiences.

I am passionate about using technology to design meaningful :hammer:, user-focused experiences. For me, 'Build your tomorrow' means using technology thoughtfully â€“ focusing on creating user-centered solutions <img src="./UX-SE.png" alt="UXIcon" width="9%"/>, constantly learning, and aiming to build things that help connect and uplift others :bulb:. It's about progress, not perfection, and making a positive contribution, one step at a time.
More than the technical challenge, I'm driven by the potential I see in technology to foster connection and uplift communities. I know I have a lot to learn, but I approach problem-solving with determination and a genuine desire to create solutions that truly put people first. For me, integrity is key. Following my personal motto, **'Build your tomorrow,'** I'm actively seeking opportunities to learn from others, contribute meaningfully, and use my growing skills to help build a better, more connected world, one step at a time. Letâ€™s connect and do something great! :toolbox:
